Reflection 1
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Response:
One would want to use a remote repository when:
-the work is ready to be shared with non-local users (collaboration).
-there is a desire to maintain the work in 'the cloud' for ease of access regardless of machine or
    geographical location.
-there is a desire to increase the redundancy of maintaining the data (avoid local machine breaking).
