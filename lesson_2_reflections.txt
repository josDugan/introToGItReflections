Reflection 1
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Response:
Initializing a repository  creates hidden .git files in the directory where executed.
These files will contain meta-data to help with the version control processes.  One
must do it if ones wishes to use the git version control tools.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Response:
The working directory can contain files that are not in the staging area and may never
be committed to git.  The staging area represents a way to mark files in the working
directory as 'commit'able to git. Both of these differ from the repository, as the 
repository--when it contains files--contains the last committed version of the files
in the staging area.  These files are preserved in their state at the time of the commit.
Additionally, the repository can contain previous states of thes files.  So, essentially, the
repository contains a collection of file-states--usually associated with each other in a
persisting way.
**Aside:  It seems that questions of personal identity are relevant to files and file states.
